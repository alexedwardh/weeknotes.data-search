## Week 7: 08-09-2017

### Community

A (final) reminder that our [4th Parliament, data and democracy meetup](https://attending.io/events/parliament-data-and-democracy-meetup-4) is next Thursday (14th September) at [Newspeak House](https://www.nwspk.com/). 

There will be interesting talks, nice people and [free beer](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/31717/what-do-the-phrases-free-speech-vs.-free-beer-really-mean/). You should probably come.

### Search

The big news this week was our new search service going live on Wednesday. Where live means search forms on the current website now point to the new search results. It's built on the same technology stack as the [beta website](https://beta.parliament.uk/) and searches over every parliamentary sub-domain (there are many) we expose to search engines. For now this doesn't include the new beta pages which [currently block robots](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html). As new pages start to replace current pages and redirects are added we'll expose them to robots and the new search will start to include them in results. Many people worked on this. Thinking credit goes to Robert.

Matthieu worked with Usman and James from the website team to gently performance test their new implementation of the search web application, to gain confidence it could cope with the expected load once launched. They used the same load previously used to test the search API service. Results were satisfactory.

Robert and [Dia](https://twitter.com/DN78) presented the new search at the website show and tell. A feedback mechanism and tracking were set up. Dia orchestrated the internal and external communications including a [blog post which is free to read here](https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/2017/09/06/launching-the-new-search-service-on-parliament-uk/).

### Capability

We were joined by [Andy Mabbett](https://twitter.com/pigsonthewing) ([pigsonthewing](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Pigsonthewing/2017-09))on Tuesday and Wednesday for a workshop on the fundamentals of [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) and [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL). Assorted people from the Digital Service data and website teams and folks from the House of Commons Library came along.

[Samu](https://twitter.com/langsamu) prepared those new to SPARQL by holding a [one hour introduction to the query language](https://twitter.com/langsamu/status/905163842589773824) on Monday.

On Tuesday [Dan](https://twitter.com/dasbarrett) brought his children into the office to say hello. He also brought a pie. Which he had made.

### Domain modelling

[Anya](https://twitter/bitten_), [Silver](https://twitter/silveroliver) and [Micheal](https://twitter/fantasticlife) spent Wednesday morning preparing slides for their [Euro IA](http://euroia.org/) talk on [Domain Driven Design in Parliament](http://euroia.org/sessions/domain-driven-design-at-uk-parliament). [Mike Atherton](https://twitter.com/mikeatherton) joined them in the afternoon to talk about the book he's writing on similar matters and give feedback on the presentation. Consensus was reached that part of the presentation sounded nutbag. They decided to change the presentation.


### Measuring things

Matias created a dashboard connection for the House of Commons Library's Enquiry database. This will be used by Liz, Sara and Saffiyah to produce better reports.

### Corporate data

Matias deployed an update to the events management system to improve the handling of issues.


### Strolls

Still no strolls this week :-(
