## Week 1: 28-07-2017

After a brief hiatus we thought we should pick up on publishing weeknotes again.

These roughly cover the last three weeks. A less tardy service will follow.

Previous weeknotes can be found [on the PDS blog](https://pds.blog.parliament.uk/?s=%22Fortnight+notes%22).

Recently...

Having been unceremoniously evicted from our meeting room we held our usual planning data day in the sunshine in St James's Park. Or at least the dappled shade. Much was discussed and it felt productive.

Dan, Ben, Sara, Saffiyah, Liz, and Matthieu visited the National Audit Office. Dan spoke about the new data service and search to their data analytics group and got some good leads on actual user needs for our data / API.

Robert attended the "capability reset" meeting with Julie and others, where the revised pitch was discussed and slides were looked at. He also met with Colin to hear about how he's managing the Members' product on the beta website.

Samu, Matthieu and Aidan had a meeting about Google CSE where much was ironed out. 

There was the usual Friday search meeting where people heard more about work with the Microsoft API, the next steps on taking search live and preparation for hearing more from Laurenceg on search design.


I heard about data views in the #website-beta show and tell - and checked them out on Friday afternoon, bearing in mind the 'search types' discussed with @langsamu @nagd and @aidan. Also some mail support in reply to queries about Historic Hansard.
