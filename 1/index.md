It's 2017-W27. This week I attended the #capability 'reset' meeting with @juliebyrne and others, where the revised pitch was discussed and we looked at slides. I met with @cpattinson to hear about how he's managing the Members' product on the beta website. @langsamu @matthieu @aidan and I had a meeting about Google CSE where much was ironed out. Data day on Wednesday in St. James' Park was novel. We got through a lot, I think. I recovered from the heat by taking a day of leave on Thursday. Friday's #search weekly was good: people heard more about work with the Microsoft API, the next steps on taking search live and preparation for hearing more from @laurenceg-grinyer on search design next week. I heard about data views in the #website-beta show and tell - and checked them out on Friday afternoon, bearing in mind the 'search types' discussed with @langsamu @nagd and @aidan. Also some mail support in reply to queries about Historic Hansard.

It's 2017-W30. I met with Samu and Matthieu on the search API and resurrecting a 'tech demo' on Azure, also spoke on medium-term search work and API content, met with the search team on current progress and next steps, wrote some PHP, met with Aidan on project delivery. I'm sure there's something else ... oh yes, podcast planning.
